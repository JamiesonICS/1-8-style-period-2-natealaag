              <th> <h2>"Naruto" follows the journey of Naruto Uzumaki, a 
                young ninja with a dream of becoming the strongest 
                leader of his village, the Hokage. Orphaned at a 
                young age, Naruto struggles for recognition and respect,
                 as he harbors the Nine-Tails Foxâ€”a powerful beast that 
                 attacked his village years ago. As he trains alongside his friends
                  Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha, Naruto faces various challenges, 
                  including rivalries, friendships, and the complexities of his past.
                   The story explores themes of perseverance, friendship, and the 
                   quest for identity.
                 Throughout the series, Naruto confronts powerful enemies, uncovers 
                 hidden truths about his family, and learns the value of teamwork. 
                 The narrative spans his growth from a mischievous outcast to a 
                 heroic figure, ultimately culminating in epic battles and a deeper 
                 understanding of peace and acceptance.The manga, created by Masashi
                  Kishimoto, was serialized from 1999 to 2014, and the anime 
                  adaptation aired from 2002 to 2017, becoming a cultural phenomenon 
                  and spawning numerous spin-offs, including "Boruto: Naruto Next 
                  Generations." </h2></th>
