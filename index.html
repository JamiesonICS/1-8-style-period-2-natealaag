    <h1>Early life and early projects:</h1>

      <h2><strong>Masashi Kishimoto</strong> is a world renowned Mangaka (manga author) 
        who created the biggest worldwide Manga and anime of all time. Born on November 8th, 
        1974 in The okayama prefecture, in Japan as the 
        older identical twin of Seishi Kishimoto. Even at a young age Masashi showed great 
        interest in drawing anime, one of his main hobbies would be to draw characters from 
        his favourite shows, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Slump">
          <strong>Dr.Slump</strong></a> ,

        and his brother started the anime that really jumpstarted his passion of being a mangaka.
         Masashi kishimoto started idolising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball"> 
          <strong> Dragon ball's</strong></a> Author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Toriyama">
            <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong></a>(RIP), enjoying not only his series Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, but also 
            Dragon Quest, a role-playing video game for which Toriyama was art designer. While he 
            could not afford to buy Weekly Shōnen Jump where the Dragon Ball manga was published, 
            he followed the series thanks to a friend from school who had subscribed to the 
            magazine. By high school, Kishimoto started losing interest in manga as he started 
            playing baseball and basketball (like yours truly) However, upon seeing a poster 
            for the animated film Akira, Kishimoto became fascinated with the way the 
            illustration was made and wished to imitate the series' creator Katsuhiro Otomo's 
            style In an attempt to pursue his dream of becoming a manga artist, Kishimoto 
            attended an art college and spent time drawing manga throughout his last years of 
            education.[8] Since Weekly Shōnen Jump had not released a manga in the Chanbara 
            genre, Kishimoto thought he should try his hand at writing one after starting 
            college. But in those same years, Kishimoto began reading works in this genre, 
            like as Blade of the Immortal by Hiroaki Samura and Rurouni Kenshin by Nobuhiro 
            Watsuki. After reading Akira, Kishimoto says he has never been astonished by manga 
            and realized he still couldn't match with them. Kishimoto began creating manga 
            for magazine contests during his sophomore year of college. But he pointed out that
             his writing was geared for a younger audience, much like seinen manga. mature 
             readership as opposed to children's shōnen manga.[10] Kishimoto felt his style 
             was inappropriate for Shōnen Jump and wished to make a manga for the magazine that
              appeals to a younger audience. Kishimoto began studying the works of animators
              after being taken aback by the character designs used in the anime series Hashire 
              Melos!. Later on, he got to know Tetsuya Nishio, the designer of the anime version
              of the manga Ninku, who he considered to be a major inspiration. Kishimoto 
              observed that his style began to resemble shōnen series, and he was now mimicking
                the style of drawing from numerous character designers from anime series.</h2>
